## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide-data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") # data entry error =1, affter arrange we get rid of it 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit.

``` r
aggregate_df =
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate…

``` r
results_df =
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop.tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)), # x is number of success and n is total number
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop.tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
    ) %>% 
 # %>% pull(prop.tests) delete tidy_tests in mutate then do this
  select(-prop.tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%  #show the test tibble
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state,estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df){
  n_unsolved...
  n_total...
  prop.test(...)
} ##amother way to solve this problem

homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% # data entry error =1, affter arrange we get rid of it 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Error: 'data/homicide-data.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('/Users/Anna/Desktop/P8105 data science/p8105_hw5_mb4757').

## Problem 2

take a look at 1 csv file

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

make the tibble and tody the results

``` r
path_df =
tibble(
path = list.files("lda_data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~ read_csv(.x))) %>% 
    unnest(data) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("path", "other"), sep= "/") %>% 
  separate(other, into = c("arm", "rest"), sep= "_") %>% 
  separate(rest, into = c("ID", "remain"), sep= 2) %>% 
  select(-path, -remain) %>% 
  filter(arm == "con")
```
